    "Approach\n",
    "First, we iterate through the characters in s and t in parallel. For each character in s, we check if it is already mapped to a character in t.

If the current character in s is not already mapped to a character in t, we check if the current character in t has already been mapped to by another character in s. If it has, then the strings are not isomorphic and we return false. Otherwise, we create a mapping between the current character in s and the current character in t in both hash tables.\n",
